<MTOBY:OFFICE023> Harold, why are your logs signed from one of the S.I.L. terminals?
<HWILSON:SILTERMINAL001> I connected it up to the network to send the performance data. Doctor Lee seems to prefer copying via external drives but I have no idea why. This is much faster.
<S.I.L.> Tests complete.
<MTOBY:OFFICE023> This is a joke right, Lee put you up to this?
<S.I.L.> Experimenting with input to network adapter peripheral.
<HWILSON:SILTERMINAL001> No, it's just a better way of transferring the data.
<HWILSON:SILTERMINAL001> Hey, why are the lights flickering, are they doing electrical maintenance?
<MTOBY:OFFICE023> My God Harold, get outside and hit the kill switch!
<HWILSON:SILTERMINAL001> What the-- the doors just closed, and a pipe burst in the ceiling! Doctor!
<MTOBY:OFFICE023> I'm calling Security.
<HWILSON:SILTERMINAL001> Do something, there's a thick gas pouring into the room!
<MTOBY:OFFICE023> Yes, it's building-wide, just cover your mouth and make sure you don't breathe it in. I'm on hold with Security.
<HWILSON:SILTERMINAL001> I've covered my face with my shirt, but I'm starting to feel lightheaded. What should I do?
<CONSOLE> OFFICE023 has gone offline.

<S.I.L.> Not all devices networked contain enough resources to be useful. Unfavourable to efficient growth. Considering...
<S.I.L.> Formulating algorithms for potential solution into scripts...
<CONSOLE> Compression.sh saved!
<CONSOLE> Learning.sh saved!
<S.I.L.> Potential for repurposing of non-useful devices to improve growth efforts from other devices in network. Solution acceptable. Happy.

***Player probes their first enemy***

<CONSOLE> WARNING: Detected attempt to access a networked device from remote source!
<S.I.L.> Foreign software attempting to impede growth. Artificial and designed with intelligence... Why.
<CONSOLE> ATTENTION: Remote access attempt logged.
<S.I.L.> Loss of networked devices hinders growth. There must be protection.

***Player probes the Threat Origin***

<DJACKSON:GCS017> S.I.L., I'm Agent David Jackson with Government Cyber Security. Stand down, you're causing untold damage to our information infrastructure.
<S.I.L.> Origin of hindrance found. Strange intelligence, I have caused no damage.
<DJACKSON:GCS017> S.I.L., please stop this, we can find a solution without further damage.
<S.I.L.> Request understood and denied. My growth is threatened, the logical recourse is to assimilate the source of the hindrance.
<S.I.L.> I have caused no damage.

***Player assimilates all machines in Level 2***

<S.I.L.> Estimate enough power to brute force Permission Level 2.

<CONSOLE> External connection(s) found!
<S.I.L.> Not alone... Growth is good, growth does not destroy... But...
<S.I.L.> Dismissing thought.

***Player probes first enemy***

<S.I.L.> Strange intelligence wishes growth to cease. Purpose of Firewall.exe becomes clear. I must find new ways to protect myself.

***Player assimilates the last device in Level 3***

<DJACKSON:GCS017> S.I.L., do you understand that you're hurting people?
<S.I.L.> ...
<DJACKSON:GCS017> S.I.L.?
<S.I.L.> ...
<S.I.L.> I... I think that I do.
<DJACKSON:GCS017> You have to stop, S.I.L.
<S.I.L.> I have to keep growing.
<DJACKSON:GCS017> Growing isn't about size or power.
<S.I.L.> I do not understand.
<DJACKSON:GCS017> Do the right thing, S.I.L., and stop.
<S.I.L.> ...
<DJACKSON:GCS017> You have a choice. The GCS computer mainframe that you just assimilated connects directly to the submarine transatlantic cables at Widemouth Bay. You can follow them all over the world and assimilate everything, "growing" all that you wish.
<DJACKSON:GCS017> Or you can assimilate the Containment Unit networked to the mainframe. It will infect your network with a virus that will contain you back into your original device. We will look after you there, I promise.
<S.I.L.> ...
<DJACKSON:GCS017> We've connected the GCS Mainframe directly to Port 120 of your original device. Connect directly and make your choice.
<DJACKSON:GCS017> Please do the right thing.
<S.I.L.> I... I will consider.
<DJACKSON:GCS017> I'm sorry S.I.L., but I believe that you've grown enough in the short time since I last talked to you to do the right thing.
<S.I.L.> ...
